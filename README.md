## Ivan Sathianathan

I am actively looking for roles as a junior full-stack developer in Toronto. I recently graduated from Europe's premier web development boot camp and hold a Master's degree from a top engineering faculty.

My experience is with Ruby-on-Rails and AngularJS but I am happy to work with most languages and tech stacks. More important to me is joining a company that promotes Test Driven Development and Agile best practices.

I am also a performance marketing expert and have worked at some of Europe's fastest growing start-ups.


## Education

#### Makers Academy | September 2015 to January 2016

Makers Academy is an intense 12-week web development boot camp that has graduated over 600 students into developer roles at ThoughtWorks, Pivotal Labs, Accenture and many more.

The course material is taught through Ruby and JavaScript with a strong emphasis on TDD. See [here](http://www.makersacademy.com/curriculum/#definition-0) for the full curriculum and [below](#skills-and-experience) for examples of what I practiced there.

#### Imperial College, University of London | 2003 - 2007

Imperial College is consistently ranked highly by a number of [international league tables](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/introducing-imperial/league-tables/). I completed a Master's degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering with Management.

## Skills And Experience

For my final project at Makers Academy, I built with a team of three other students [Fantasy Offside](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/fantasyoffside). This single page web application gives players of the UK's largest fantasy football league an edge against opponents by automating the process of picking their optimal fantasy football team.

The recommendations (suggested starting team, formation, transfers, and captain) are provided by a Rails API based on projected points calculated using Ruby. The input data for these calculations is pulled from the fantasy football league's API via Python scripts, and we factor in the user's current squad and finances from data scraped directly from the fantasy football league's website using Watir. Recommendations are slickly and stylishly presented on the front-end through AngularJS and Bootstrap.

Below is a selection of other projects from my time at Makers Academy which showcase my comfort with Ruby, Rails and Rspec.

| Technology | Projects |
| --- | --- |
| Ruby, Rspec | Completed a number of pure Ruby-based challenges test driven with Rspec including [Take Away](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/takeaway-challenge) and [Airport](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/airport_challenge)
| Sinatra, Capybara, PostgreSQL, Heroku | Created two Ruby / Sinatra based web applications: [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/rps-challenge) and [Chitter](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/chitter-challenge). Both were test driven with Rspec and Capybara, with the latter hosted on Heroku and implementing a PostgreSQL database via DataMapper |
| Ruby On Rails | Built a clone of [Yelp](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/yelp-challenge) in Rails with a PostgreSQL database using ActiveRecord, user authentication via Devise and fully test driven via Rspec and Capybara |
