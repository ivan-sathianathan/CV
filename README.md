We created a single page web application using AngularJS and Bootstrap to automate the process of picking a user's optimal Fantasy Football team before the deadline each week (including suggested formation, transfers, captain pick, and starting 11). The recommendations were provided by a Rails API, based on projected player points using Ruby. The input data for these calculations (historical player performance information and past/upcoming fixtures) was pulled using weekly automated Python scripts. We also factored in the user's current squad and team finances when making recommendations, scraped directly from the Fantasy Premier League's website using Watir. |
