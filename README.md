## Ivan Sathianathan

I am actively looking roles as a junior full-stack developer in Toronto. I recently graduated from Europe's premier web development boot camp and hold a Master's degree from a top engineering faculty.

My experience is with Ruby-on-Rails and AngularJS. However, I am agnostic with regards preferred language and tech stack; more important to me is joining an engineering team that promotes Test-Driven Development and Agile best practices.

In my previous professional life, I was a performance marketing expert at some of Europe's fastest growing start-ups.

Both were test driven with Rspec and Capybara, with the latter hosted on Heroku and implementing a PostgreSQL database via DataMapper |
| JavaScript, jQuery, Jasmine | Created a mock [Thermostat](https://github.com/ivan-sathianathan/Thermostat) with external location based weather temperature provided by OpenWeatherMap's API, test driven with Jasmine |
| Golang | Experimented with with Golang during a Lab week, test driving a fizz-buzz kata (link) and basic ten-pin bowling challenge (link) |

| Python, Ruby On Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap | Fantasy Offside, my final project at Makers Academy, built with a team of three other students. We created a single page web application using AngularJS and Bootstrap to automate the process of picking a user's optimal Fantasy Football team before the deadline each week (including suggested formation, transfers, captain pick, and starting 11). The recommendations were provided by a Rails API, based on projected player points using Ruby. The input data for these calculations (historical player performance information and past/upcoming fixtures) was pulled using weekly automated Python scripts. We also factored in the user's current squad and team finances when making recommendations, scraped directly from the Fantasy Premier League's website using Watir. |
